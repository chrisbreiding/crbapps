### Scorekeeper

Sarah and I needed a way to keep score when playing Rummy and I'm too cool for pen and paper.

Utilizes React, CoffeeScript, JSX, and RequireJS.

    Add player boards and scores. Score totals are calculated automatically. Data is saved in local storage.

    Try out keyboard shortcuts when editing a score (up & down arrows, enter, tab & shift-tab).
