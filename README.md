### Random Password

Created as a quick way to get a "random enough" password.

    Obtain a random password.

    - Length defaults to 14 characters
    - Add a numeric second segment for a custom length (eg, http://crbapps.com/randpass/25)

### Scorekeeper

Sarah and I needed a way to keep score when playing Rummy and I'm too cool for pen and paper.
