## CRB Apps

Mini-apps, experiments, and fun stuff

    Play with fish. Create them, move them around, change their color.

### Random Password

Created as a quick way to get a "random enough" password.

    Obtain a random password. Ensures there is a lowercase letter, upperacase letter, and number. Length defaults to 14 characters. Add a numeric second segment for a custom length (eg, http://crbapps.com/randpass/25)

### Scorekeeper

Sarah and I needed a way to keep score when playing Rummy and I'm too cool for pen and paper.

    Add or subtract players. Add their names. Scores are calculated when you hit [Enter].
